# ComputerNetworks
For the subject "computer networks" within the Faculty of Informatics at "Alexandru Ioan-Cuza" University in Iasi. We developed the well-known game "Don't worry bro!", a multi-threaded game that allows you to have several game sessions at once. The game has a login/register system (through a unique user and password) and the game also has a statistics system, where players can see the statuses of some players, top10, or their own statuses.
