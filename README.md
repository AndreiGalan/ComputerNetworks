# ComputerNetworks
For the subject "computer networks" within the Faculty of Informatics at "Alexandru Ioan-Cuza" University in Iasi. We developed the well-known game "Nu te supara, frate!", a multi-threaded server-client game that allows you to have multiple game sessions at once. The game has a login/register system (through a unique user and password) and the game also has a statistics system, where players can see the statuses of some players, top10, or their own statuses.
